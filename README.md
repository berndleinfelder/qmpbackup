qmpbackup
=========

qmpbackup is designed to create live full and incremental backups of running
qemu virtual machines via QMP protocol. It makes use of the dirty-bitmap
feature introduced in later qemu versions. It was mostly created for
educational purposes and is by no means complete.

Prerequisites
-------------

The virtual machine must be reachable via QMP protocol on a unix socket,
usually this happens by starting the virtual machine via:

```
 qemu-system-<arch> <options> -qmp unix:/path/socket,server,nowait
```

qmpbackup makes use of this socket to pass needed commands to the
virtual machine.

Usage
-----

In order to create a full backup use the following command:

```
 qmpbackup --socket /path/socket backup --level full --target /tmp/backup/
```

the command will create a new dirty bitmap and backup the virtual machines
disks to ```/tmp/backup/<disk-id>/FULL-<timestamp>```. It ensures
consistency by creating the bitmap and backup within one QMP transaction.

See the following discussion on the qmeu-block mailinglist regarding
this topic:

 https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2016-11/msg00682.html

Second step is to change some data within your virtual machine and let
qmpbackup create an incremental backup for you, this works by:

```
 qmpbackup --socket /path/socket backup --level inc --target /tmp/backup/
```

the changed delta since your last full (or inc) backup will be dumped to
```/tmp/backup/<disk-id>INC-<timestamp>```, the dirty-bitmap is automatically
cleared after this and you can continue creating further incremental backups by
re-issuing the command likewise.

Filesystem Quisce
-----------------

In case the virtual machine has an guest agent installed you can set the Qemu
Guest Agent socket (```--agent-socket```)  and request filesytem quisce via
```--quisce``` option:

```
  qmpbackup --socket /tmp/vm --agent-socket /tmp/qga.sock backup --level full --target /tmp/ --quisce
```

Restore
-------

Restoring your data is a matter of rebasing the created qcow images by
using standard tools such as qemu-img or ```qmprebase```.

A image backup based on a backup folder containing the following backups:

```
 /tmp/backup/ide0-hd0
 ├── FULL-1480542683
 ├── INC-1480542701
 └── INC-1480542712
```

can be rolled back by using ```qmprebase```, it uses common qemu tools to check
consistency and does a rollback of your image file:

```
 qmprebase  rebase --dir /tmp/backup/ide0-hd0
```

While rebasing the saveset chain is merged into your FULL image which then
contains the latest state and can be booted via Qemu again.

Misc commands
-------------

In order to remove existing dirty-bitmaps use:

```
 qmpbackup --socket /tmp/vm cleanup --remove-bitmaps
```

see 

```
 qmpbackup --help 
```

for more information and commands.

Limitations
-----------

1) As persitent dirty-bitmaps were added to qemu in 2.10, dirty-bitmaps are 
saved through vm shutdowns.

2) Using the QMP protocol it cannot be used together with libvirt as libvirt
exclusively uses the virtual machines monitor socket. I think it will make sure
to provide a good implementation of the dirty-bitmap feature in the future.

3) Qemus ```drive-backup``` function does currently not support dumping
data as a stream, it also cannot work with fifo pipes as the blockdriver
expects functions as ftruncate and fseek to work on the target file.
